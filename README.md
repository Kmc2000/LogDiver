# What's this about?
This tool aims to make the process of reviewing SS13 game logs for player complaints and the like less painful for the end-user. Quickly find out what a given player was doing in a round or simply examine logs in a more colourful environment than notepad.

# Features:
* View all your logs from a centralized, convenient location. Point it at a folder filled with .log files, and it'll separate each log file out into tabs for ease of viewing.<br/>

* Per log colour highlighting. Get a bigger picture when examining logs through colourful text.<br/>
* Global log searching. Need to see what one player was doing? You can search through all the loaded logs at once with the searchbar! (Gone are the days of checking each individual file manually with notepad)<br/>
* Per log filtering. Don't care about some logs for a player? Filter them out. The tool comes preset with a focused log view to get you set up with the most commonly needed log views.<br/>

# Installation:
Head on over to https://github.com/Kmc2000/LogDiver/releases and grab the latest version you see. Then just run the .exe file it downloads!

# Usage:
Most of the UI is self-explanatory. When you start the log diver, it'll immediately prompt you to select a folder filled with logs. You can throw pretty much anything at it, just as long as it's a folder that contains files ending in .log (It currently does not accept other filetypes at this time, and is thus suitable only for ss13 logs).
